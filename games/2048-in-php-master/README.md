# 2048-in-php

<h1>About</h1>

A 2048 game that is made to fit in only one .php file, including the Css.
It won't have ANY javascript or flash. Everything will be calculated serverside.
The goal is not to have a perfect game, but to have a game that doesn't calculate stuff on your computer.
It's more of a programming challenge...
If you're interested in similar projects featuring javascript, just google it, you will find.
