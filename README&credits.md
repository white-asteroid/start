first host test
I just made this website for the purpose of learning and i am gonna use it for my project submission(you can also use it to submit it for major project as i connected website to datbase).
all the games are open source and i didn't do the their coding except for the part where it stores scores and send it to database. 

All i did is front-end coding and database connect using php for ex log in modal, signup modal etc

I used gaming code of Steven Lambert(github id : straker) and added feature to display score (took help of comments :P) 
you can visit this for original code ->
